# Exercise 1: A good first program

# Copy these lines as is:

print('Hello World!')
print('Hello Again')
print('I like typing this.')
print('This is fun.')
print('Yay! Printing.')
print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
print('I "said" do not touch this.')


# Study Drills
# 1. Make you script print another line.
# 2. Make your script print only one the lines
# 3. Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line.
