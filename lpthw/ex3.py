# Exercise 3: Numbers and Math

print('I will now count my chickens:')

print('Hens', 25 + 30 / 6)
print('Roosters', 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

print('Now I will count my eggs:')

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

print('Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?')

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

print('What is 3 + 2?', 3 + 2)
print('What is 5 - 7?', 5 - 7)

print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print('How about some more.')

print('Is it greater?', 5 > -2)
print('Is it greater or equal?', 5 >= -2)
print('Is it less or equal?', 5 <= -2)


# Study Drills
# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what 
#    the line does.
# 2. Start Python from the command line and use it as a calculator.
# 3. Find something you need to calculate and a write a new .py file that does 
#    it. (Note: Try to play with the exponent '**' operator)
# 4 - 5. Skipped as Python 3 has made handling of fractions straightforward.
