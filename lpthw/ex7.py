# Exercise 7: More printing

print('Mary had a little lamb.')
print('Its fleece was white as %s.' % 'snow')
print('And everywhere that Mary went.')
print('.' * 10)  # What would that do?

end1 = 'C'
end2 = 'h'
end3 = 'e'
end4 = 'e'
end5 = 's'
end6 = 'e'
end7 = 'B'
end8 = 'u'
end9 = 'r'
end10 = 'g'
end11 = 'e'
end12 = 'r'

# Watch the comma at the end. Try removing it to see what happens.
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6),
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)


# Study Drills
# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# 2. Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.
# 3. From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what
#    kind of mistake you made.
# 4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and 
#    try not to make them in this new one.
# 5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who 
#    like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an 
#    act. They make mistakes all the time.

# Personal Challenge
# 6. Print the word 'boom!' 100 times.
