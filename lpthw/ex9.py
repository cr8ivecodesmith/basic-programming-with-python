# Exercise 9: Printing, printing, printing

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = 'Mon Tue Wed Fri Sat Sun'
months = 'Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug'

print('Here are the days: ', days)
print('Here are the months: ', months)

print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.

# Study Drills
# 1. Do your checks of your work, write down your mistakes, try not to make 
#    them on the next exercise.

# Personal Challenge
# 2. Print the months string through the %r formatter. What happened to the 
#    output? Why do you think is that?
