# Exercise 2: Comments and pound characters

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print('I could have code like this.')  # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print("This won't run.")

print('This will run.')


# Study Drills
# 1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure
#    you know what it's called (octothorpe of pound character).
# 2. Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backwards. Start at the
#    last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have 
#    typed.
# 3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
# 4. Read what you've typed above out loud, including saying each character by 
#    its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
